# Welcome to my Github! ^w^
## Who am I?
I am a university student in computer science and math. I love programming, and I love tackling hard problems
## What do you do?
My specialty is low level work. My favorite language is C, but I am also very proficient in C#, Java, and Rust. I occasionally dabble in JavaScript and Python as well.

I mostly apply my skills in desktop applications including game development. I try to build tools to solve problems I and others run into.

Anything in my pinned is cool!
